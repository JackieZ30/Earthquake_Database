# Earthquake Database

This repository contains an earthquake database in CSV format along with two Java programs for data analysis.

## Data Source

The earthquake data is stored in a CSV file named `earthquakes.csv`. You can find the file [here](https://github.com/JackieZ30/Earthquake_Database/blob/main/earthquakes.csv). The dataset includes information about various earthquakes, such as the date, time, location, magnitude, depth, and other relevant details.

## Programs

### 1. Earthquake.java

The `Earthquake.java` file contains a Java class that provides functionality for processing earthquake data. This program includes methods for reading earthquake data from the CSV file, filtering earthquakes based on certain criteria, and performing analysis on earthquake attributes.

You can find the source code for `Earthquake.java` [here](https://github.com/JackieZ30/Earthquake_Database/blob/main/Earthquake.java).

### 2. main.java

The `main.java` file serves as the main program that utilizes the `Earthquake` class to perform specific tasks on the earthquake data. This program demonstrates how to use the `Earthquake` class to read earthquake data, apply filters, and perform analysis.

You can find the source code for `main.java` [here](https://github.com/JackieZ30/Earthquake_Database/blob/main/main.java).

## Usage

To use the earthquake database and analyze the data using the provided Java programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Open the repository in your preferred Java development environment.
4. Compile the Java files (`Earthquake.java` and `main.java`) if necessary.
5. Run the `main` class to execute the program and analyze the earthquake data.

## Contribution

If you find any issues with the earthquake database or the Java programs, or if you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
